# Advance Regression Assignment
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

## General Information
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know:

 * Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

 * How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

## Conclusions
The model building process and evaluation using the R-squared score provide valuable insights into predicting bike demand. Business goals can be aligned with demand dynamics, contributing to better decision-making.
